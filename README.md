# Chrome: Flash Edition
A version of Chrome that cannot update, so it should run Adobe Flash without issue beyond December 31, 2020.
We believe that what created an impact shouldn't just disappear, so here we are, making Flash work again.
Our goal is to create a version of Chrome that can:
1. Run Adobe Flash after December 31, 2020. (Check!)
2. Sign into Google. (Currently in beta, but still, check!)
3. Not update. (Check!)
